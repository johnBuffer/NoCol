## Usage

The following keyboard shortcuts are available

* <kbd>E</kbd> toggle v-sync. V-sync limits the number of frames per second, so disabling it speeds up the simulation.
* <kbd>A</kbd> toggle the visibility of the traces.
* <kbd>space</kbd> toggle slow-motion.
* <kbd>R</kbd> reset the view.
* <kbd>esc</kbd> close the application.

You can zoom into the simulation by scrolling, and move around by dragging with the mouse.
